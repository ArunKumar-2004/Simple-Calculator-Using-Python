# Simple-Calculator-Using-Python
Created a simple calculator program in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and the operation they would like to perform. The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

The program uses Python's built-in arithmetic operators to perform the calculations, and it also includes error handling to prevent division by zero. The calculator outputs the result of the operation, and gives the user the option to perform another calculation or exit the program.

Overall, this simple calculator program demonstrates the basics of programming in Python, and can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications.
